# aws-bucket-content-analyzer
This is my very first bash script that I wrote to help me automate my work analyzing open buckets. 
It is meant solely for ethical hacking and disclosure.

It lists file names using aws CLI, sorted according to folder, size and date.
It also creates a file with all file names that include the word 'logo', as I found those files helpful in the attribution process.
Also creates a file with total number of files and total size for each folder.

you are ging to need a list of bucket names you'll want the script to go over, and you can modify the directories in the script to your convenience
